# Anonchat pingbot

A proof-of-concept "ping-pong" bot made for [anonchat-v2](https://github.com/anonchat-org/anonchat-v2).

---
## Setup
The bot can be configured by changing some variables in `bot.py`, the name and the prefix, to be exact.

Compile the bot by running the `build.sh` script, get the binaries in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Calamity34/ac-pingbot/releases/latest), or run the bot with the Dart SDK by doing `dart run bot.dart <arguments>`

The bot can be run with `./bot host:port`, for example `./bot 127.0.0.1:2345`.
